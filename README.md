#### Evaluation

At the end of the course, there will be a 3-hour exam covering everything we’ve learned, including all topics discussed:
 - Pharo syntax (blocs, loops, messages etc)
 - Double dispatch
 - Visitor
 - AST and interpreters

The exam will include both multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. You may also be asked to draw a diagram or an AST, as well as write a small piece of code (we will not evaluate the correctness of the code too strictly, but focus more on the general idea).

Using any course materials or electronic devices during the exam is not allowed.
